On being a female on a male dominated engineering team

A year and a half ago I was hired as the first female software engineer for what was then a team of twelve male developers. When I first joined the team I wanted to "blend in' as much as possible. I planned to never bring up the fact that I was a woman (not that it wasn't obvious), but my hope was to act like 'one of the boys' and do good work, and if no one noticed I was any different it would be a success. That all went out the door pretty quickly. I'm glad, and here's why.  

I didn't so much as acknowledge it at first. I kept my head down and did my work.  My company is fully remote, and shortly after I started, our CTO tasked each of us on the dev team to create a brief intro video that other people in the company could watch so they'd know who we are and what we do. The videos were sent out, twelve starring male devs and one starring me. Everyone loved them. Many of the guys on my team could also be employed as comedians or musicians and they didn't hide it. But something definitely stuck out. The first e-mail we got back concluded with: 

> My key learnings - Dark & Stormy, Topo Chico, and we now have a FEMALE WM Software Engineer!

As positive as the feeedback was to my joining the team from the rest of the company, that didn't change my mind about wanting to 'not make a big deal of it.' I still had doubts about being seen differently within my own team.

It wasn't until my leadership brought it up that I started to embrace it. My managers are supportive of me, and they tell me that, and that is great. They encourage me to apply to speak at conferences, even going as far as to say they'd campaign for the whole team to attend any conference I am accepted to speak at. This may seem like special treatment or in some ways unfair. "Reverse-sexism" some might call it.  I don't see it that way. This industry treats women differently, so my managers treat me differently in the exact opposite way the industry does. Tech conferences have much fewer female speakers than male speakers, and that can be intimidating and discouraging for female engineers. That was very true for me, but their encouragement counteracted my fear. I'm not sure I would have ever applied or put myself out there if it weren't for them.

Recently there's been a lot of talk about how a woman's is perceived as 'bossy' or 'bitchy' more so than a man who says the same thing. To avoid this misconstrual women have to be more apologetic and passive[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2015/10/13/jennifer-lawrence-has-a-point-famous-quotes-the-way-a-woman-would-have-to-say-them-during-a-meeting/]. I often need remind myself to be LESS apologetic and to speak my mind. At my company, we remote pair program 100% of the time, meaning I spend ~7 hours a day on a hangout or skype call with the same person for weeks at a time, while we work on the same code. It is my favorite thing about my job, but it's a lot. Every developer on my team has their own unique approach to the code, a different background and level of experience. Inevitably, there will be differences of opinion regarding the work, and debates, arguments, tiffs, whatever you'd like to call them, happen. One of my coworkers compares it to going from best friends to roommates.  What I've learned is that just because I am a woman does not mean i'm going to fight with you about the code any more than my male counterparts. I've been tri-pairing and witnessed two senior male engineers in an argument, and it was far more tense and long-lasting than any code debate i've been in. If i'm being assertive or confident while pairing, and if we go back and forth about an implementation, I will of course follow good pairing protocol, but i'm not going to apologize for it. That didn't come inherently, and I have to actively work on it.

A little over a year after being on the team, I was chosen to be the engineering lead on a project. This entails writing the code with most likely one other person (your pair), making decisions about it, being the point person for questions about it and attending meetings. Immediately I was excited about it and proud that my work had led others to trust my technical and soft skills. My second thought was, did they choose me because I'm a woman and they think i'm super organized and just 'bossy' enought that i'd be a good leader? I couldn't help thinking that way. But after that, I simply asked. My VP was honest with me and told me those ideas never crossed his mind, and I was chosen for other reasons around technical ability and business context. I was then honest with him; I was happy to take this work on, but my desire is to stay technical and I don't want to be pushed into management and away from code. He explained that this is a choice all software developers need to make at some point in their careers. I couldn't agree more, and I'm glad for this opportunity to experience both. FWIW I still sling code all day long.

At the beginning of this year, our team had more than doubled and we hired our second female software engineer. We've discussed how we feel about this subject in depth. We feel very similarly about the struggle to find a confident voice. It has been hard to find a balance between the assertive women we are and strive to be and the empathetic, sensitive women we as many women are by nature. I want to be taken as seriously as my male counterparts, so I do speak up in meetings, and if some read that as being 'bossy', I can't help that. I shouldn't hold back *because* i'm a girl. Conversely, i've found myself less confident to push back on PM's because I am empathetic to their position, noticably more so in my opinion than the guys. I have worked late at night to finish a feature for a client to make a deadline, because to me that seems like a promise, and I never want to break a promise in my personal life, and that carried over into my work. I'm cogniscent of these differences, and I try to be thoughtful in my actions in reaction to them, but most of it I wouldn't change. To expect men and women to behave the same all the time is unrealistic.

A lot of the points ive mentioned are things that we as women face daily, not just working in tech. They are exaserbated when there are a bunch of dudes around because you're experiencing this stuff all the time, the good and the bad. I feel my experience has been positive and encouraging, and I think the positive experiences of female engineers deserve to be shared as much as the negative ones. Definitely a step in the right direction if not the last stop. I speak to my coworkers as my equals, because they are. I don't downplay my gender difference or emphasize them, I just be myself and work hard, and that works for me. And for those that think like I did 18 months ago, it IS a big deal to be a female engineer, especially on a male dominated team. Not just for you, but for your team! For every person hired on the team, there's probably 10 other people that weren't chosen, and they're probably 10 dudes. You worked hard to get here and you've probably had more obstacles in your way than most developers. Surround yourself with people that support you, don't work with people that don't.
