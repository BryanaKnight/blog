On being a female on a male dominated engineering team

- When I first joined the team I wanted to 'blend in' as much as possible. I planned to never bring up the fact that I was a woman (not that it wasn't obvious), but my hope was to act like 'one of the boys' and do good work, and if no one noticed I was any different, that was a success.  That all went out the door pretty quickly, and I'm glad, and here's why.  I didn't make a big deal out of it, but other people rightly did. My company is fully remote, and our CTO tasked the engineering team with the task of creating brief intro videos that other people in the company could watch so they'd know who we are and what we do. 24 videos were posted of male engineers, along with 1 female engineer: mine. Everyone loved all the videos. Many of my fellow devs could also be employed as comedians and musicians and they didn't hide that in their messages. The e-mail response concluded with: 

My key learnings - Dark & Stormy, Topo Chico, and we now have a FEMALE WM Software Engineer!

It IS a big deal to be a female engineer, especially a singular one on a male dominated team. Not just for you, but for your team! For every person hired on the team, there's probably 10 other people that weren't chosen, and they're probably 10 dudes. You worked hard to get here and you've probably had more obstacles in your way than most developers. 

That great response didn't change my mind about wanting to be like everyone else. It wasn't until my manager brought it up that I started to embrace it. 

- My managers are supportive of me, and they tell me that, and that is great. They encourage me to apply to speak at conferences, even going as far as to say they'd campaign for the whole team to attend any conference I am accepted to speak at. This may seem like special treatment or in some ways unfair, "reverse-sexism" some might call it.  I don't see it that way. This industry treats women differently, so they treat me differently in the exact opposite way the industry does. Tech conferences have much fewer female speakers than male speakers, and that can be intimidating and discouraging for female engineers. That was very true for me, but their encouragement counteracted that doubt. I'm not sure I would have ever applied or put myself out there if it weren't for them.

- I don't downplay my gender difference or emphasize it, I just be myself and work hard, and that works for me. I speak to my coworkers as my equals, because they are. Recently an article came out about how what women say is construed completely differently compared to men who say the same. A woman's tone is perceived as 'bossy' or 'bitchy' than a man's when they say the same thing, and to avoid this misconstrual women have to be more apologetic and passive. What I gathered from that article is that I need to be LESS apologetic and more confident in my voice. At my company the engineers remote pair program 100% of the time, meaning I spend ~7 hours a day on a hangout or skype call with the same person for weeks at a time, while we work on the same code. Every developer on my team has their own unique approach to the code, a different background and level of experience. Inevitably, there will be differences of opinion on the code, but what I've learned is that just because I am a women does not mean i'm going to fight with you about the code any more than my male counterparts. I've been tri-pairing and witnessed two neck-bearded senior engineers in a power struggle over what direction to go in, and it wasn't pretty, and far more tense than any code-tiff i've been in with. If i'm being assertive or confident while pairing, and if we debate about an implementation, I will of course follow all good pairing protocol, but i'm certainly not going to apologize for it.

- I recently was chosen to be the tech lead on a project, a choice made by my management and other engineers. This entails building the project with most likely one other person (your pair), being the point person for questions about it (asked mainly by leadership and other depts) and attending meetings about it where many decisions are made, retrospectives, etc. My first thought was that I was excited and proud of myself since they say something in me that led them to believe I was technically bad-ass enough to do this. My second thought was, did they choose me because I'm a woman and they think i'm super organized and maybe even 'bossy' so obviously I'd be capable of managing.

- Less confident to push back on PM's. Empathize too much with PM's. Jump through hoops to deliver because don't want to disappoint. Other people handle things differently like asking more of PM's before doing extra work.

- To expect men and women to behave the same all the time is unrealistic. 

- A lot of the points ive mentioned are things that we as women face daily, not just working in tech. They are exaserbated when there are a bunch of dudes around because you're experiencing this stuff all the time, the good and the bad.

- I feel my experience has been positive and encouraging. Definitely a step in the right direction if not the last stop.
