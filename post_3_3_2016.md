Here are some helpful tips that make my development faster, and maybe you, too!


### Aliases

##### `alias glod='git log --graph --pretty="%Cgreen%h%Creset%Cblue%d%Creset %Cred%an%Creset: %s"'`

Your output will look something like this:

### Vim Shortcuts

##### `iabbrev bpry      require 'pry'; binding.pry`

Every time you type the letters "bpry", `require 'pry'; binding.pry` magically appears.

Abbreviations are super handy but they are powerful and easy to overuse. I recommend abbreviating after you've had to type something so many times that you've *noticed* and its becoming annoying. 

You can also use abbreviations for words you commonly misspell or type. For example: `iabbrev initalize      initialize`


##### `Ctrl + 6`

This switches you back and forth between two buffers in the same pane. For example, you could switch between a file and it's test, or a controller and a view. I've found this super helpful in my effort to not have 234890 vim panes open at once.

##### `%:h` + tab

Entering `:e %:h` in vim will populate the prompt with the current file's path excluding the file itself, so you can easily switch to another file within the same directory. This of course also works with `:vsp` and `sp`. For example, if you are editing the `UsersController` and you want to go to the `OrdersController`, just enter `:e %:h` and finish the path with `orde..` tab complete!
