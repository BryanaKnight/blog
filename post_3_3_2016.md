I recently transitioned from a company where I remotely pair programmed almost all the time to one where I pair a handful of times a week. At the former, our dotfiles were well-loved but standardized for remote pairing. Everyone was used to and knew all the commands because, well, we all used them. Recently I've been reminded of just how neat some of those shortcuts are. Here are some helpful tips that make my development faster, and maybe you, too!

### Aliases
</n>
**`alias glod='git log --graph --pretty="%Cgreen%h%Creset%Cblue%d%Creset %Cred%an%Creset: %s"'`**

I use this to see the commit history for the branch I'm on. 

Your output will look something like this:

![](/content/images/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-15-at-7-20-24-PM.png)

**`alias gap='git add -p'`**

Short for `git add --patch`, this will allow you to review the diff and optionally stage certain hunks of the patch and not others. This is because this effectively runs in interactive mode.

I want to stage this  hunk, so I enter `y`

Here's a quick reference of the possible commands when given the option to stage the patch **[y,n,q,a,d,/,s,e,?]**:

* y YES stage this hunk
* n - NO do not stage this hunk
* q - QUIT out of interactive staging
* a - stage ALL the hunks in this file (not just this one)
* d - DO NOT stage this hunk or any of the others in this file
* / - search for a hunk with regex (it will prompt you for one)
* s - SPLIT hunk (it will then give you smaller hunks)
* e - EDIT the current hunk

### Vim Shortcuts
</n>
**`iabbrev require 'pry'; binding.pry      require 'pry'; binding.pry`**

Every time you type the letters "require 'pry'; binding.pry", `require 'pry'; binding.pry` magically appears.

Abbreviations are super handy but they are powerful and easy to overuse. I recommend abbreviating after you've had to type something so many times that you've *noticed* and its becoming annoying.

You can also use abbreviations for words you commonly misspell or type. For example: `iabbrev initalize      initialize`

**`Ctrl + 6`**

This switches you back and forth between two buffers in the same pane. For example, you could switch between a file and it's test, or a controller and a view. I've found this super helpful in my effort to not have 234890 vim panes open at once.

**`%:h` + tab**

Entering `:e %:h` in vim will populate the prompt with the current file's path excluding the file itself, so you can easily switch to another file within the same folder. This of course also works with `:vsp` and `sp`. For example, if you are editing the `UsersController` and you want to go to the `OrdersController`, just enter `:e %:h` + tab

![](/content/images/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-15-at-8-09-36-PM.png)

and finish the path with `orde..` tab complete!

Check out the [documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/cmdline.html#filename-modifiers) to see how that works.
