How I set up this blog

First off, I followed [this very helpful tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application), however, since I just set this up, I figured i'd blog about it.

I am using DigitalOcean Ghost. 

1. Sign in to your [DigitalOcean account](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/) and create a new Droplet with:

  * hostname - alias/identifier for the droplet and eventual site. For this I simply used 'blog'
  * size - 512 MB
  * region - Wherever is closest to you. I am in DC so I used NYC.
  * image - Select the 'Applications' tab and choose 'Ghost 0.6.4 on 14.04' 

Hit 'Create Droplet'. You'll get an e-mail with your droplet info including IP address and Password. 

2. From the DigitalOcean (assuming you're still signed in) Droplets tab, click on the name of the droplet you just created and then click the 'Console Access' button. A terminal will appear on the page. Hit enter or type anything from within the terminal prompt and it will prompt you for a login and PW. Type 'root' when first prompted and type in the PW that was e-mailed to you after that when asked. You'll then be asked to change your PW immediately, so do that. 

**Note**: I had trouble typing in the pseudo terminal while vimium was enabled in Chrome, so I just disabled it and was able to type directly into the terminal with no problem.

  Then:

  * Type `nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost` into the prompt to open the nginx config file and change the `server_name` to the domain name you want for your blog (and that you already own). Save and exit (`ctrl + x`)
  * Type `nano /var/www/ghost/config.js` to edit the ghost config file. Change the production url to that same domain name.

3. Now to link your DomainName to your DigitalOcean droplet. The domain name for this blog was purchased through GoDaddy so I will use that as an example. Go to [your account](https://mya.godaddy.com/) and hit the Manage button for the domain you're using for your blog. In the **Nameservers** section, change the names to:
  * ns1.digitalocean.com
  * ns2.digitalocean.com
  * ns3.digitalocean.com *I needed to add a third nameserver as I only had two to start*

4. Within the DNS tab on DigitalOcean, enter your Domain Name, IP Address (found in the droplet email) and then select the corresponding droplet (remember, mine was just named 'blog') from the dropdown and click 'Create Record'. You should be directed to a page that includes an line item for an 'A Record' that has an @ sign in the first field and your IP address in the second field.

That's it!
